    "The model has a fairly good understanding of back handspring progression for each level.  There are some drills that I see listed under the wrong levels, so this will require some fine tuning. I would like to see a little more description on the equipment - does this need a 4\", 8\", 12\" or 16\" mat? what size and firmness of block or incline, etc. I think the description of the drill could also be a little more detailed.  Most of them, however, give me a good idea of what the drill is and what it is trying to accomplish."

    "This one could definitely use some more fine tuning.  Giants and glide swings are very different levels of skills. Also,  - swing to handstand isn't really a thing - there's cast to handstands and giants (which are swinging all the way around the bar and can stop in a handstand).  Cast handstand and giants are both too high of skills for an intermediate recreational class.  I would also like to see an aparatus specific warm up and conditioning list - i.e. chin ups, leg lifts, swings, etc."

    "Overall, this is a great start to a practice plan.  some of the stations are too simple and some are too complex, but that has been consistant with the model not quite knowing exactly what level skills belong to. The stations are also a little to generic.  \"Kip progression\" doesn't really mean much, even when saying to use resistance bands for assistance.  I do like the gymnastics tag idea.  I have had my gymnasts play gymnastics volleyball (with a beach ball) where they have to do a skill after they hit the ball."

      "To help your gymnast effectively kick her feet over during the back handspring, here are three detailed drills that focus on improving the jump, hip extension, and overall body coordination during the skill. Each drill includes a description of necessary equipment and specific instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drill 1: **Kicking Over with Elevated Hip Extension**\n",
      "**Equipment Needed:** A plyometric box or elevated mat (about 12-24 inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "1. **Setup:** Have the gymnast stand with her back facing the elevated surface.\n",
      "2. **Starting Position:** Instruct her to place her hands on the edge of the box while keeping her feet on the floor.\n",
      "3. **Drill Execution:**\n",
      "   - From this position, the gymnast should push off the ground with her legs while simultaneously kicking her feet back and up towards her hands.\n",
      "   - Aim to create a strong arch in the back, emphasizing hip extension.\n",
      "   - She should feel the activation in her hamstrings and glutes as she tries to bring her legs up and over her body.\n",
      "4. **Focus Points:**\n",
      "   - Ensure she's engaging her core to maintain tension.\n",
      "   - Remind her to visualize kicking over while maintaining an arched position.\n",
      "5. **Repetitions:** 10-15 kicks, focusing on form and height, not hurrying through the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drill 2: **Back Handspring Progression with Spotting**\n",
      "**Equipment Needed:** A mat and a spotter (coach or teammate).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "1. **Warm-Up:** Start with a proper warm-up focusing on shoulder and back flexibility and strength.\n",
      "2. **Spotting Setup:** Have the gymnast stand next to a mat, facing away from it. The spotter should stand close, prepared to assist her if needed.\n",
      "3. **Drill Execution:**\n",
      "   - The gymnast initiates the back handspring with proper arm swing and jump. \n",
      "   - As she begins to fall backward, the spotter should provide guidance, helping her to kick her legs forward while spotting her hands to ensure she lands safely on her feet. \n",
      "   - Ensure the spotter supports her knees, giving her a small push to help bring her legs up and over.\n",
      "4. **Focus Points:**\n",
      "   - The spotter should encourage her to engage her core and actively kick her legs up and over.\n",
      "   - Reinforce the importance of an aggressive jump into the handspring.\n",
      "5. **Repetitions:** 5-10 reps, ensuring the gymnast focuses on proper form and kicking her legs while receiving spotter assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drill 3: **Back Handspring Snap Down Drill**\n",
      "**Equipment Needed:** A tumble track or soft foam runway.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "1. **Setup:** Position the tumbling track or soft foam runway on a safe, flat surface.\n",
      "2. **Drill Execution:**\n",
      "   - The gymnast begins from a standing position at the start of the tumble track.\n",
      "   - She should perform a jump back handspring, focusing on the hip extension as she goes backward.\n",
      "   - After pushing off, she lands in a sit position to mimic the snap down motion, driving her arms forward and legs back, simulating the kick-over.\n",
      "3. **Focus Points:**\n",
      "   - Stress the importance of kicking her legs towards the mat rather than keeping them behind her.\n",
      "   - Highlight coordinating movement of arms and legs — as the arms reach for the floor, the feet should be kicking over.\n",
      "4. **Repetitions:** 8-10 repetitions, reminding her to focus on quick extension of the legs and the timing of her snap down.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Tips:\n",
      "- Make sure that the gymnast practices these drills with proper supervision to ensure safety, especially during progressions that require spotting.\n",
      "- Frequent feedback and encouragement will help her improve her muscle memory and confidence in executing her back handspring effectively.\n"
